	<description>One of (in my opinion) best mods for increase the max number of memes. Alas, it hasn't appeared to be updated, so here is a temporary port:
	It is been ported by: CTH2004
	
	P.S. if the author asks, I will remove this, no questions asked. So, if it disapeares, you know why!

Anyways, here's the original (much better than mine) description:
 	
With this mod you can have way more memes with ideology (0-100 memes by default).
You can change the minimum memes and the maximum memes in the mod settings options.
You can also change how many memes NPC factions have (1-3 memes by default).
You can also change the maximum amount of venerated animals (18 venerated animals by default). </description>
